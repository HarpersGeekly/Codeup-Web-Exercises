<!--//Here's a good approach to this.-->
<!--//grab just the first element-->

<!--//var book = books[0];-->

<!--I can even make things simple with variables. -->

<!--var fullName = book.author.firstName + " " + book.author.lastName;-->
<!--var message = "Title is " + book.title + " written by " + fullName;-->
<!--console.log(message);-->


<!--//forget the loop for a moment...let's just go through it simply:-->

<!--// console.log("Title is " + book.title + " written by " + book.author.firstName + " " + book.author.lastName);-->

<!--// book = books[1];-->
<!--//console.log("Title is " + book.title + " written by " + book.author.firstName + " " + book.author.lastName);-->

<!--// book = books[2];-->
<!--//console.log("Title is " + book.title + " written by " + book.author.firstName + " " + book.author.lastName);-->

<!--// book = books[3];-->
<!--//console.log("Title is " + book.title + " written by " + book.author.firstName + " " + book.author.lastName);-->

<!--// book = books[4];-->
<!--//console.log("Title is " + book.title + " written by " + book.author.firstName + " " + book.author.lastName);-->

<!--//that's some smelly code...let's LOOP THIS CODE:-->
