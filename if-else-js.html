<!--Knowing that a student's grades are 70, 80, 95. Write a JS program, using conditionals that logs to the console "You're awesome" if the average of her grades is greater than 80, otherwise the message should be "You need to practice more".-->

<!--HEB has an offer for the clients that buy products amounting more than $200. Write a JS program, using conditionals, that logs to the browser, how much does Ryan, Cameron and George need to pay. We know that Cameron bought $180, Ryan $250 and George $320. Your program will have to display a line with the name of the person, the amount before the discount, if any, and the amount after the discount.-->

<!--Suppose your friend Isaac cannot decide between two options. He doesn't know if he should buy a car or a new house. Help him decide! Write a small JS program. The following line generates either a 0 or a 1 randomly.-->

<!--var flipACoin = Math.floor(Math.random()* 2)-->

<!--Add an if statement to log a "Buy a car" to the console if the result is 0 and "Buy a house" if the result is 1. Could this program be written using a ternary operator?-->
